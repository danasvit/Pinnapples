            <h2 id="pin">Pineapple</h2>
            <p>The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae. The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations.

            Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit. The plant is normally propagated from the offset produced at the top of the fruit, or from a side shoot, and typically mature within a year.

                According to Wikipedia, “the word ‘pineapple’ in English was first recorded in 1398, when it was originally used to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees (now termed ‘pine cones’).” When European explorers discovered this tropical fruit in South America, they called it ‘pineapple’ due to resemblance to what is now known as the pine cone.

                The first ever record of the word ‘Pineapple’ dates back to 1398.<br>

The word pineapple in English was first recorded in 1398, when it was originally used to describe the reproductive organs of conifer trees. European explorers discovered a prickly tropical fruit that they began to call pinaepples (term first recorded in that sense in 1664) because of their resemblance to what is now known as the pine cone (originally called pineapples). The term pine cone was first recorded in 1694, and was used to replace the original meaning of pineapple.

A pineapple can take up to 3 years to grow and mature into a plant.
<br>
You can only receive the fruits of a pineapples labour when it has reached full maturity, which can easily take up to three years. Even still, those grown as houseplants may be reluctant to flower and set fruit at all. 
<br>
Only one pineapple is produced by a single plant in a single season
<br>
And after all that time of reaching full maturity... You get a single pineapple. Yes, a pineapple plant will only flower and fruit once per season.
<br>
A pineapple plant can stay alive and continue giving fruits for up to 50 years
<br>
So thats 50 pineapples, in total!
